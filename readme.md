# About

`composto-rs` is _supposed_ to be a simple wayland compositor configurable using Lua.

# Goals

- [ ] executable prototype that can show a window
- [ ] lua-rust bindings / in-process lua intepreter from within a rust program
- [ ] keyboard-driven interface, basic window management (tags assigned by lua
      config, per-tag keybinding to show/hide the windows, tiling)
